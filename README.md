DarwiinRemoteLives
==================

### About

Original [DarwiinRemote](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darwiin-remote/) was a great app but it got broken under OS X 10.8. DarwiinRemoteLives is a derivative of the original DarwiinRemote driver that works on OS X 10.8. It implements the fix for the bluetooth channel retain/release issues given at http://www.hakubi.us/foundation/2012/08/fixed-darwiin-remote-on-mountain-lion/#more-2386 . I may also be adding some further customizations to this app.

A good description of the issues that needed a fix is here: http://weiv.co/stream/index.php/mountain-lion-bluetooth-woes-and-its-fix/

Another clone of DarwiinRemote that works on OS X 10.8 can be found here: http://www.matthiaskronlachner.com/?p=1574

### Install
